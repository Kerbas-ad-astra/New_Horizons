			description = Minmus is a small captured body orbiting Eeloo, and can just be seen from the surface of Kerbin, even if conditions are just right. There is a split in the scientific community as to whether it is made from ice, or ice cream. Fortunately, many hungry kerbals are lining up for a chance to eat, err... "explore" its terrain.
